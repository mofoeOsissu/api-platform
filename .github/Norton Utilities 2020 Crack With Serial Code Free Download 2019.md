SHA-2 code signing is a cryptographic technique that uses a mathematical algorithm to generate a unique signature for each file. The signature is like a fingerprint that identifies the file and its source. When a file is downloaded or installed, the system checks the signature against a list of trusted certificates to ensure that the file is genuine and has not been tampered with.
  
KB4474419 is a Windows update that adds SHA-2 code signing support to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. This update is necessary because Norton products use SHA-2 code signing to ensure the integrity and security of their files. Without this update, the system will not recognize the SHA-2 signatures and will reject the product updates above version 22.21.3.
  
Therefore, it is important to install KB4474419 as soon as possible to avoid missing out on any product updates that may improve the performance and functionality of Norton products. To install the update, users can follow these steps:
  - Go to the Microsoft Update Catalog website and search for KB4474419. - Download the appropriate version of the update for your system (32-bit or 64-bit). - Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to complete the installation. - Restart your PC when prompted.  
After installing the update, users can check for Norton product updates by opening their Norton product and clicking on Help > Check for Updates.
